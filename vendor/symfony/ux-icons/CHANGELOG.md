-    Add `xmlns` attribute to icons downloaded with Iconify, to correctly render icons browser as an external file, in SVG editors, and in files explorers or text editors previews.

We recommend you to **lock** your icons **before** upgrading to UX Icons 2.24. We also suggest you to to **force-lock** your icons **after** upgrading to UX Icons 2.24, to add the attribute `xmlns` to your icons already downloaded from Iconify.

-   Add support for `int` and `float` attribute values in `<twig:ux:icon />`.

## 2.19.0

    icon is not found.

## 2.17.0

-   Add component
